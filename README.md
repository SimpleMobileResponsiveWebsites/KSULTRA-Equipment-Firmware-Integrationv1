In cryptomining, khashes (kilohashes) represent 1,000 hashes per second45. A hash is a single computation or "guess" at solving a block in cryptocurrency mining4. The term "khash/s" or "kH/s" stands for kilohashes per second, which is a measure of mining speed45.
Khashes are considered a very slow rate of hashing in the context of modern cryptocurrency mining5. To put it in perspective, here's how khashes compare to other hash rates:
Kilohash per second (kH/s): 1,000 hashes per second
Megahash per second (MH/s): 1,000,000 hashes per second
Gigahash per second (GH/s): 1,000,000,000 hashes per second
Terahash per second (TH/s): 1,000,000,000,000 hashes per second
As mining difficulty has increased over time, most modern mining operations use much higher hash rates, typically measured in terahashes per second or even higher units5.
